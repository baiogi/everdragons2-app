      ['Where will the new dragons live?',
        <span>Polygon Proof-of-Stake.</span>],

      ['How much will a new Everdragon cost?',
        <span>Anything from 5000 Matic when the sale starts down to 200 Matic after 5 hours. The price will drop by 1% every minute (Dutch auction). Early community members will have discounts.</span>],

      ['What makes a new Everdragon rare?',
        <span>First, the dragon's purity. There are 8 pure dragons, 24 dragons of the 2nd generation, 96 dragons of the 3rd generation, etc. In addition, dragons have 123 rarity attributes like jewels, fancy clothing, particular wings or tails. The also have auras and background skies. Finally, there are some exceptional dragons... you'll see ðŸ™‚</span>],

      ['How do I buy a new Everdragon?',

      ['What type of token are the new Everdragons?',
        <span>Each new Everdragon is an ERC-721 token. Metadata and images will be served by Everdragons2, but their consistency and immutability are guaranteed (read <Ab label={'this blog post'} link={'https://medium.com/ndujalabs/everdragons2-fair-tokens-distribution-9c6f77c748f6'}/> for more details).</span>],

      ['Any advantage for original Everdragons holders?',
        <span>Definitely yes. Holders of the original dragons can claim as many Everdragons2 as they hold in the form of original Everdragons in Ethereum, Tron, and/or POA Network.</span>],

      ['Where can I purchase the original Everdragons?',
        <span>The best place to go is OpenSea. Look at the <Ab link={'https://opensea.io/collection/everdragons'}
